# ReactInterviewHub
I'm collecting the interview questions for React developers.<br>
Actually, what I want to share with you is: Fundamentals!<br>
This is the core for everything, not just the interview. Plus, I highly recommend you consider your own words and experience to answer each question that will show you are alive and always thinking.

<br>
<br>

The questions will be divided into two sections: The General Questions and The Tech Questions.

## [General Interview Questions](GeneralQuestions/GENERALQUESTIONS.md)
Some introduction and discussion about yourself or your previous projects here.

<br>
<br>

## [Tech Interview Questions](TechQuestions/TECHQUESTIONS.md)
The tech questions will be separated into five parts roughly just according to my feeling, definitely not accurate!

<br>
<br>

### [JavaScript Interview Questions](TechQuestions/JavaScriptInterviewQuestions.md)
### [Junior Developer Interview Questions](TechQuestions/JuniorDeveloperInterviewQuestions.md)
### [Medium Developer Interview Questions](TechQuestions/MediumDeveloperInterviewQuestions.md)
### [Senior Developer Interview Questions](TechQuestions/SeniorDeveloperInterviewQuestions.md)
### [Specific for React Native Developer Interview Questions](TechQuestions/ReactNativeDeveloperInterviewQuestions.md)

## [Collections](Collections)
Of course, as a software developer, I have a bad habit which is eager to collecting all interesting resources around the world, such as [articles](Collections/InterestingArticlesList.md), [books](Collections/InterestingBooksList.md), [tools](Collections/InterestingToolsList.md), [websites](Collections/InterestingWebsitesList.md), [projects](Collections/InterestingProjectsList.md), etc. I always dream those stuff will level me up one day, even though I don't have enough time to finish them all:(
