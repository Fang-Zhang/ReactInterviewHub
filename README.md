# ReactNativeInterviewHub
I'm collecting the interview questions for React Native developers.<br>
Actually, what I want to share with you is: Fundamentals!<br>
This is the core for everything, not just the interview. Plus, I highly recommend you consider your own words and experience to answer each question that will show you are alive and always thinking.

The questions will be divided into two sections: The General Questions and The Tech Questions.

## [General Interview Questions](GeneralQuestions/GENERALQUESTIONS.md)
Some introduction and discussion about yourself or your previous projects here.

## [Tech Interview Questions](TechQuestions/TECHQUESTIONS.md)
The tech questions will be separated into three parts roughly just according to my feeling, definitely not accurate!
